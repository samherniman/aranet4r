The [Aranet4](https://aranet.com/products/aranet4/) is a portable indoor
air quality sensor for measuring CO<sup>2</sup>, temperature,
atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. These devices are accurate
and fun to use, however they are unable to store historic measurements
for longer than a fortnight. This package is designed to combine
exported Aranet files (in CSV format) into a single dataframe.

Currently, this package has a single function which combines all your
Aranet files into one and removes duplicate entries. Eventually this
package will include functions to plot these results, add them to a
database, and potentially connect directly to oneâ€™s device.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aranet4r from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("samherniman/aranet4r")
```

## Recommended workflow

The following is the workflow that I use, feel free to use whatever
method you would like. The main takeaway is to save all of your aranet4
CSVs to a single folder and then run `read_aranet` on that folder. This
will then return a dataframe with all of them combined.

1.  Connect to your Aranet4 through Bluetooth on your phone ðŸ“± using the
    Aranet4 app (available on the App Store and Google Play Store)
2.  Export Aranet data to a cloud drive that syncs with your computer,
    like iCloud. Share menu \>\> save to files \>\> new folder (name it
    *Aranet4* or something) \>\> save
3.  Use `read_aranet("path/to/your/aranet/files")` to read in the files

``` r
library(aranet4r)

df <- read_aranet(system.file("extdata", package = "aranet4r"))
```

``` r
dplyr::glimpse(df)
#> Rows: 499
#> Columns: 7
#> $ recorded_date_time        <dttm> 2022-10-20 20:21:24, 2022-10-20 20:23:24, 2â€¦
